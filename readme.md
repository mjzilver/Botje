# Discordbot aka Botje

A discord bot made for myself and friends. This bot was built entirely for my own entertainment, and is not intended for public use. Botje was first created on Feb 6, 2019.
If you're interested in creating your own private Discord bot for fun, feel free to take a look at the code on my GitHub repository. 
However, please note that this bot is not intended for public use, and I cannot provide support for any issues you may encounter.
